ACGPY/A Clicker Gaem:Python Edition is a game created using Python (with some libraries) by Binray. it attempts to "recreate" A Clicker Gaem (also known as ACG) but with more features & being a standalone app instead of being tied to scratch. It is currently being built from the ground up since the old code (current in the github) was flawed and unoptimized.

Features (in the github code):
1. Shapes which you can click and gain money.
2. Upgrading to switch shapes and to gain money.
3. Basic UI.
4. And an unfinished Shop.
